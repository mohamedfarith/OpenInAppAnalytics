# Dashboard Analytics App

## Overview

This is a Dashboard Analytics app built with Jetpack Compose, following the MVVM pattern with Clean architecture principles. It utilizes Dagger Hilt for dependency injection, Navigation Graph for smooth transitioning between screens, Retrofit for networking using Kotlin Flows and Coroutines, and JUnit for unit testing.

## Features

- **Jetpack Compose:** The app's UI is built using Jetpack Compose, making it modern, reactive, and easy to maintain.

- **MVVM Architecture:** The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture, separating concerns and making the codebase modular and scalable.

- **Clean Architecture:** The project structure is organized following Clean Architecture principles, promoting a clear separation of layers and dependencies.

- **Dagger Hilt:** Dependency injection is handled by Dagger Hilt, making it easy to manage and test dependencies.

- **Navigation Graph:** Smooth transitioning between different screens is achieved using Navigation Graph, providing a seamless user experience.

- **Retrofit with Kotlin Flows and Coroutines:** Networking is done with Retrofit, leveraging Kotlin Flows and Coroutines for asynchronous and reactive programming.

- **Unit Testing with JUnit:** The app includes unit tests using JUnit to ensure the reliability and correctness of the codebase.
